# What's inside?
This is a backup for which I used for setup a server after installed Ubuntu for reverse tcp-proxing Minecraft with HAProxy using docker and docker-compose, then limit web ports only valid for connections from CloudFlare.

# Notice
Please remember to update settings in `haproxy/haproxy.cfg` for HAProxy.
